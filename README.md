# Esirem-Robot-Exploration
In order to explore risky environments, the robot will need to be able to move in multiple axes. Its movement should be adapted to various terrains (rocky, flat, sandy...), which we'll limit here to include wet conditions. To enable remote visualization of what the robot captures, it will be equipped with an integrated camera (webcam) and live image transmission. This camera should be capable of detecting desired objects from a distance. Additionally, it will require a robotic arm for controllable and automated interaction with the surroundings.

Our material needs are as follows:
- A chassis with its battery
- A brushless motor for movement
- A camera
- A robotic arm
