The project has been completed with the aim of describing it for the GitHub repository.

"To explore high-risk environments, the robot has been equipped to maneuver across multiple axes, adapting its movement to various terrains such as rocky, flat, sandy, and wet conditions. For remote visualization of its footage, the robot is equipped with an integrated camera (webcam) and live image transmission capabilities. The camera is designed to detect desired objects from a distance. Furthermore, the robot features a controllable and automated robotic arm for interacting with its surroundings.

Our material requirements for the project include:
- A chassis with its battery
- A brushless motor for movement
- A camera
- A robotic arm"
